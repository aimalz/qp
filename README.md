# qp

Quantile parametrization for probability distribution functions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aimalz/qp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aimalz/qp)[![Documentation Status](http://readthedocs.org/projects/qp/badge/?version=latest)](http://qp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)


## Motivation
This repository exists for two reasons.

1. To be the home of `qp`, a python package for handling probability distributions using various parametrizations, including a set of quantiles;
2. To help us learn best practices in software carpentry.

## Examples

You can run the `qp` IPython notebooks live over the web at [Binder](http://mybinder.org):

To make sure you are running the latest version, you can rebuild the Binder `qp` installation [here](http://mybinder.org/status/aimalz/qp).

You can also browse the (un-executed) notebooks here in this repo:
