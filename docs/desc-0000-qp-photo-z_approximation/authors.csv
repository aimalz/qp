# authors.csv
#
# While we wait for the LSST DESC publications system to generate files
# like this from its database, we'll need to edit authors.csv by hand.
# Below are some example entries.
#
# Notes:
#   - If someone has two affiliations, they get two rows, and the last row is
#     is used for their contribution.
#   - mkauthlist cannot deal with empty rows, so please avoid them!
#   - Try to make your one-sentence contribution statement as informative as
#     possible, so that it's clear who did what.
#   - The contribution statement is a _summary of your impact on the project_,
#     not a _timecard_. So, if you spent 90% of your time debugging, but 10%
#     of your time designing and implementing the framework that then needed
#     debugging, your statement should emphasize the design and implementation
#     rather than the debugging.
#   - BUG: contributions are re-formatted by mkauthlist into Title case,
#     removing all other capitalizations. Sorry about this!
